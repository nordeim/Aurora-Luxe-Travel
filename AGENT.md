Key responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) live in globals.css under @theme.                                                                                                                                                           
- Form validation follows the regex /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/ for email and requires all fields.                                                                                                                                       
- Image handling uses Next.js <Image> with responsive fill and lazy loading.                                                                                                                                                              
- Scroll navigation uses section IDs (#destinations, #experiences, etc.) and smooth scrolling.                                                                                                                                            
- Performance: Images optimized via Unsplash URLs, animations limited to 60 fps, LCP target < 2.5 s.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Overall, the codebase follows a strict “no‑global‑state, component‑local‑state, Tailwind‑v4‑first” philosophy, with all UI built on Shadcn‑UI primitives that are then stylized to match the Celestial Noir aesthetic. The project is     
production‑ready, passing type‑checking, linting, and accessibility checks.

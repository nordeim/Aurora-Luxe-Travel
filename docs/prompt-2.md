Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please think deeper and think harder to meticulously explore thoroughly and systematically how best to create a detailed, comprehensive, informative and attractive `README.md` for the GitHub repo that hosts this project. include a section to describe the application architecture with a file hierarchy diagram listing key files with their description, a mermaid diagram to describe the user and application interaction, and a mermaid diagram to show the application logic flow, and a section on deployment. Try to make it an awesome, complete, and useful `README.md` for the project. Then meticulously create a plan to create the `README.md`. Review and validate the plan before proceeding cautiously to execute.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now review and modify the existing project scaffolding files and adjust your execution plan accordingly if need be. Next, meticulously proceed to execute your validated master execution plan phase by phase sequentially. Make sure to verify the generated code files against the plan's checklist at the end of each phase (make sure you have included integrated checklist in your updated master execution plan. Use `Test Driven Development` methodology for coding to ensure enterprise-grade and production readiness of the final codebase.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please on the hat of a security audit hat to very carefully, systematically and critically review and scrutinize the current codebase to double-check that it does indeed comply with industry best practices on security and privacy, especially in relation to Singapore's very strict financial regulatory frameework. Also conduct a meticulous and critical security audit review of the overall user authentication and authorization to prevent hacking and to to prevent fraud. Did we implement a robust user registration, authentication and authorization workflow, add an admin role for the Admin Dashboard, password strength enforcement and other industry best practices on security and privacy. First, use thorough and critical code review to identify gaps in security and privacy best practices, then meticulously plan to create a remediation plan with phased execution and integrated checklist. Review and validate the remediation plan against the codebase to ensure correct and accurate alignment with the overall application architecture.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously review dynamic landing page captured and saved from the browser  @landing_page.html and compare it against the static landing page mock-up @static_landing_page_mockup.html to identify why the location section is missing from the dynamic landing page. Then meticulously validate your findings against the codebase to identify the actual root cause. Then meticulously plan and fix the missing location section issue.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously review dynamic landing page browser screenshot [Image ...c_page_top.png] and compare it against the browser screenshot for the static page mockup [Image ...c_page_top.png] , you will notice the visual discrepancies like the fonts and background animations and top navigation bar color. Please meticulously validate the visual discrepancies against the actual codebase to identify the actual root cause. Then meticulously plan and fix the visual discrepancies between the dynamic page and static page mock-up. You can use the `chrome-devtools` mcp to check the rendered output on the browser yourself.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work. Now, please meticulously review the codebase files to align your understanding of the current state of the project and the actual implemention. Then meticulously create a briefing document for an AI coding agent to be able to continue from the present state. After conducting your meticulous codebase review to align your understanding of the codebase, you will create a comprehensive *single-source-of-truth* briefing document for any coding agent or human developer to have the same deep understanding of the project and the current codebase status. Save the agent *briefing document* that captures your aligned and validated understanding as a markdown file `CLAUDE.md`.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously plan and create the detailed comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` with file hierarchy diagram with listing of key files and their description, mermaid diagrams to show the application flowcharts and the database schema. Review and validate the PAD against the project planning documents and the actual codebase. Finally, create a detailed and comprehensive `Project_Architecture_Document.md` in the project root folder, as the single source-of-truth handbook to fully initialize new developer or another coding agent to be able to handle new PRs independently.

Create the comprehensive `Project_Architecture_Document.md` in the root folder.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously review @README.md , @CLAUDE.md , @Project_Architecture_Document.md and @CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md , then meticulously plan to update them with the recent code changes, particularly pertaining to the hardening and closing of gaps identified during code review. Ensure that the updated documents correctly and accurately align with the current project status and current codebase. You have to validate any findings or doubts against the current codebase, supplemented by document search using Context7 MCP or web searches so that all claims are grounded in reality.

> Perfect! I've created MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md - a comprehensive, meticulously planned execution document that breaks down the entire project into 6 logical, independent phases.

## What I've Delivered

### 📋 Master Execution Plan Structure

6 Independent Phases:

1. Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration (2 hours)
   - 6 files: package.json, configs, globals.css, layout.tsx
   - Design system setup, fonts, metadata

2. Phase 2: Utilities & Hooks (1 hour)
   - 3 files: utils.ts, useScrollSpy, useReducedMotion
   - Reusable functions and custom hooks

3. Phase 3: Data Layer (30 minutes)
   - 4 files: destinations, experiences, membership, testimonials
   - TypeScript interfaces and mock data

4. Phase 4: UI Primitives (3 hours)
   - 9 files: Button, GlowOrb, SectionHeading, GlassPanel, Input, Select, Textarea, ChipGroup, Toast
   - Reusable UI components

5. Phase 5: Layout & Sections (5 hours)
   - 9 files: Navbar, Footer, Hero, Destinations, Experiences, Membership, Testimonials, ConciergeForm, page.tsx
   - Complete page assembly

6. Phase 6: Polish & Optimization (2 hours)
   - Animation refinement, responsive testing, accessibility audit, performance optimization, cross-browser testing

### 📝 For Each File, I've Documented:

✅ Purpose - What the file does  
✅ Features - Complete feature list  
✅ Interfaces - TypeScript interfaces with full signatures  
✅ Checklist - Detailed verification items (150+ total checkpoints)  

### 🎯 Key Features of This Plan:

1. Logical Independence - Each phase can be completed and tested in isolation
2. Progressive Enhancement - Foundation → Features → Polish
3. Minimal Code Focus - Only production-ready, essential code
4. Comprehensive Checklists - 150+ verification points across all files
5. Time Estimates - Realistic 12-16 hour total timeline
6. Validation Protocol - Pre-execution, post-phase, and final validation
7. Troubleshooting Guide - Common issues and solutions
8. Success Criteria - Clear functional, non-functional, and business requirements

### 📊 Validation Results:

✅ Pre-Execution Validation Passed:
- All phases are independent ✓
- Each file has clear purpose ✓
